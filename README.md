# Call me Justin. Or mogwai. I don't mind!

### I'm a fullstack web developer on his way to becoming *very dangerous* with JavaScript, and slightly intimidating with Python. I started writing code in August 2019, and in that time I've built a handful of web apps (and toys!) - [you can find them here](https://justinirabor.com/projects).

## What I'm currently working on

### Creosote
I'm a huge comicbook nerd and I've dabbled in [creating some myself](https://obaranda.com). Lately I've been reimagining the whole webcomic experience for a digital-first approach. I find that some aspects of traditional comic book optimizations persist, that constrain the storytelling possibilities for webcomics. I write about how I think about stories on my Substack titled [Do while thinking](https://dowhile.substack.com), and as the name implies, I'm thinking about comics right now and building my first comic book project. It involves a frontend, a database, an API and of course, a lot of drawing and writing for the actual comic!

See early prototype below:

It's not coincidental that it looks like Netflix. I think there is a cinematic appeal I'm trying to reinject into comicbooks.

### Memori-a
I participated in the Facebook AR Hackathon in May (and was part of a team that created Memori-a, an AR filter for remembering the dearly departed). 

### Astrofy for Spotify

Love horoscopes? Love serendipity? Love music? I collaborated with Seyi Taylor (who had the idea) to build [Astrofy](https://astrofy.live)
