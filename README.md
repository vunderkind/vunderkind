### First, an introduction:
Je suis le renard de Philip Tetlock. A fullstack web developer fascinated with things that move and respond to the touch. Loves beautiful UI, surprisingly clever business logic and engaging with other knowledge workers about the arcane arts of their disciplines. 
Current stack: React, Node, MongoDB/SQL/Firebase. 
Design: Procreate, Figma, the Adobe Suite, good ol' pen and paper. 
Previous life: Head of Growth for many a startup in SSA. Did really good work too!

### Pronouns:
He/him.

### Currently working on:
Moolah, a PFM application to help as many hapless souls who don't have a handle on their money. As dogfooding goes, I've been using the MVP of this product (an honest-to-god spreadsheet, would you believe that?) since January 2020 to encouraging results. 
Stack: React (front-end), Firebase(backend, including db, auth and everything in between).
Design: Figma
Animation: Procreate 

### Looking to collaborate on:
Web monetization, gamedev and XR. 

### Looking for help with:
Algorithms, math and computer science in general. 

### Ask me about:
JavaScript, animation and illustration. 

### Best way to reach me?
Good ol' email: justin.irabor@gmail.com

### Fun fact about me:
If a song is >160BPM, it's already my favorite song.
