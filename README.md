Hello there! My name is Justin (friends call me vundie/mogwai — take your pick, I'm not fussy) and I'm a full-stack developer at [TradeCore](https://tradecore.com) where I'm maintaining our customer panels and APIs for our B2B customers to build powerful fintech apps — in the crypto, payments and trading space. 

I'm a [Bloom Institute of Technology](https://www.bloomtech.com/) grad and created [Angels Among Us](https://qz.com/africa/1843839/nigerias-coronavirus-lockdown-is-hitting-poor-families-hard/), a P2P donation website, at the peak of the lockdown in 2020.
